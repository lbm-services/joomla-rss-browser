# RSS Browser for Joomla 3.x

RSS Browser module to import RSS feeds from external sources and show full-text feed messages in a customizable modal window with navigation. 

Native Joomla 3.x version

RSS news page opens in a modal window, so the user does not have to leave your site or switch to another window to read all news provided.


##Usage

+ Install just like any other Joomla extension
+ Activate the module
+ Assign to a position and menu entry
+ Go to module settings and enter a valid rss url
(must return a valid rss file! This is XML, NOT HTML!) 
e.g. http://www.heise.de/security/news/news-atom.xml
+ see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS for an introduction to RSS

## Known issues

- displaying news page in an iframe might not work if the news server of the imported feed sends certain x-frame options header. This is normal browser behaviour and no bug.
